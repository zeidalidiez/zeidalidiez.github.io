      <h3>About Me</h3>
<p> With prior experience in tech project management as well as IT, I specialize in the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Bridging the communication gap between experts and end-users.</li>
<li>Taking charge of seeing all aspects of a project come to completion</li>
<li>Engaging in thorough research and logic checks</li>
<li>Maintaining an open line of communication with all moving parts of a task</li>
  </ul>
<p>Get in touch with me about how we can work together to build something exciting!</p>

<p>Located in Auburn, WA. I am close to Seattle and Tacoma.</p>

<p>I love learning and seeking new experiences.</p>

<p>Years as a program administrator for a large telecom company eventually led me to the field of IT, in which I developed the skills to track and execute complex projects. I further refined my project managing abilities while interning at a tech focused marketing company.</p>

<p>I have spent all of my life fiddling around with scripting as a hobby for various videogames and modifications of existing games. I love to 'take things apart' and figure out how they work - they're all fun logic puzzles.</p>
